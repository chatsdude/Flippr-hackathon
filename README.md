**Problem Statement**:
The spread of COVID-19 in the whole world has put the humanity at risk. The resources of
some of the largest economies are stressed out due to the large infectivity and
transmissibility of this disease. Due to the growing magnitude of number of cases and its
subsequent stress on the administration and health professionals, some prediction methods
would be required to predict the number of cases in future.
When will the coronavirus pandemic come to an end? The question is on everyoneâ€™s mind,
and while astrologers and politicians have answers, few scientists want to be drawn into
hazarding a prediction.
The challenge of the Covid-19 prediction is the most crucial component for countries and
global health institutions. A successful and accurate prediction to the future covid cases
ultimately results in better management of the pandemic.
Part -01:
The objective of the first part of the problem statement is to predict the Covid Cases of a
City on 1st September 2020. The output file 01 should contain only City and the respective
Covid Cases for the test data.
Part -02:
The Foreign Visitors of a city is a time-dependent parameter, for which you have to come up
with a Time-series prediction model. Using the Foreign Visitors predicted by the model, you
need to calculate the Covid Cases on 1st Oct 2020 for every City in the test data. . The
output file 02 should contain only City and the respective Covid Cases on 1st October.
